# EyeContact - Video Calling Application for Visually Impaired People

EyeContact is a web based application that aims to help visually impaired people during video calls. The designed application converts visual information, e.g. facial expressions and gaze of the other person in the call, to voice indicators for the visually impaired user. EyeContact allows its users to make video calls with their contacts through Google account authentication. The application analyzes and interprets the video feed during the call using computer vision techniques, and generates voice indicators that depict visual details and behavioral cues about the other party in the call. 

This is the video call application part without Image Processing Module.
